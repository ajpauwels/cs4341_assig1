On average (given our 5 test examples) the iterative search was able to find a solution faster than the best-first search.
This was however not the case when the iterative search could not find  the answer in time due to a large branching factor.
Best-first search was also not able to find the most efficient path all of the time.

Test 2 is an example of where best-first search finds a solution when iterative cannot find one in time.
Test 3 is an example of where best-first search finds a solution but not an optimal one, however iterative search does.
Test 4 is an example of where best-first search gets caught in a loop.
